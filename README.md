This is a Foundry VTT module that adds D6 Fantasy Roleplaying Game content to an OpenD6 Space System game. It is based on Star Wars D6 by West End Games, an older system, out of print, and freely available And community REUP edition of rules. This is not a full game system--it relies on the OpenD6 Space System. (which is also free and released under OpenD6 OGL) in Foundry Virtual Tabletop to work properly.

This is a fan-compiled content module based on the fan-produced _Star Wars: Revised, Expanded and Updated_ and _D6 Fantasy_ rulebooks. Module incorporates several homebrew desisions based on love for REUP rule set and desire to use it in Fantasy setting.

## OpenD6 Space to D6 Fantasy Configurator

This module includes options to apply REUP + homebrewed D6 Fantasy labels and rules options to an OpenD6 Space game with a single click in the module settings. This eliminates much of the set up for a new world in FoundryVTT. It applies [these settings](https://github.com/SogeMoge/fantasyd6-essentialcompanion-od6s/blob/main/fantasyconfigchecklist.md) to your world. After clicking the configuration button, you may go in and change additional settings manually to set your game to 1E, or 2E REUP.

## This module is based on [The Essential Companion to Star Wars D6 on OpenD6 Space for FoundryVTT](https://github.com/DarthBanjo/starwarsd6-essentialcompanion-od6s)]

## ✨ Contents:

This module contains compendium packs for the following Star Wars D6 content:

- Skills & Advanced Skills (To-Do)
- Magic spells and Miracles (To-Do)
- Character Templates from D6 Fantasy rulebook (To-Do)
- Weapons and Armor (To-Do)
- Assorted Helpful Macros (To-Do)
- Typical Gamemaster Characters (To-Do)

**Note:** The Advanced skills need manual editing to set the initial value to 1D by players/GMs. This is done by setting negative values on the skill sheet. Automatic advancement does not take into effect their doubled character point cost, nor will they add their value back onto their prerequisite skills automatically.

**Note:** Importing a character template can take up to a minute as it searches for all the skills and items.
